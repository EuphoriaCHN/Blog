          As a middle school student, my priority is study, which occupies most time and energy in my life. Therefore, my life sometimes seems a little boring. However, it’s not that bad. First, study brings me knowledge that will be useful to all my life. Learning new knowledge brings me a sense of achievement. In addition, I like staying with my friends and classmates. We have much fun in daily life, which makes our life in school colorful. We play games or do exercises in spare time. We share our happiness as well as support each other when we are upset. All in all, life is beautiful, although we must spend most time in study. And we should hold a positive attitude towards life.
